Senior Profile Management System

Led the development of a cloud-based system for the Senior Services Society of British Columbia (SSSBC) to streamline data management, improve operational efficiency, and enhance the quality of care provided to seniors

Analyzed inefficiencies and conducted stakeholder interviews to define system requirements and evaluate potential solutions

Leveraged AWS cloud services to build a serverless architecture for scalability and cost-effectiveness. Implemented a full-stack development approach using:

o Amplify: Streamlined development and deployment across frontend, backend, and API

o Cognito: Established secure user authentication for authorized access

o DynamoDB: Used a NoSQL database to efficiently manage seniors' personal information

o S3: Provided secure and scalable storage for senior-related files

Utilized GraphQL for efficient data retrieval, and employed Vue.js to build a frontend interface for the system
